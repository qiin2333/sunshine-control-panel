- src/
  - main/ # Main thread (Electron application source)
  - renderer/ # Renderer thread (VueJS application source)
```

## Using static files

If you have any files that you want to copy over to the app directory after installation, you will need to add those files in your `src/main/static` directory.

Files in said directory are only accessible to the `main` process, similar to `src/renderer/public` only being accessible to the `renderer` process. Besides that, the concept is the same as to what you're used to in your front-end projects.

#### Referencing static files from your main process

```ts
/* Assumes src/main/static/myFile.txt exists */

import {app} from 'electron';
import {join} from 'path';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';

const path = join(app.getAppPath(), 'static', 'myFile.txt');
const buffer = readFileSync(path);
```
